# Name of Project
Save the Date is a fridge and pantry/food waste tracker. Food can either be 'devoured' or 'wasted'. Once food has been wasted, it becomes a permanent part of the database and cannot be deleted by the user. This gives the user the food waste information that they need. The 'send text' button will send a text message to the user in the form of a link to the web app. https://limitless-beach-11146.herokuapp.com/#/home
